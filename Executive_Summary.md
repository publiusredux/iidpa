#### Executive Summary
Executive Summary: Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA)  
Overview and Purpose  
The Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA) is a comprehensive immigration reform bill addressing the estimated 14–15.4 million individuals residing in the United States without lawful status. It establishes an orderly, constitutionally grounded framework for compliance, departure, or enforcement while protecting civil liberties, enhancing national security, strengthening labor markets, and ensuring due process. Rooted in Congress’s plenary authority and aligned with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Act avoids both mass amnesty and mass removal, instead providing four structured compliance pathways, a two-strike deterrence system, and rigorous oversight to restore public trust.  

Key Findings and Necessity  
Congress identifies that prolonged widespread unlawful presence strains border resources, immigration courts, detention capacity, and labor markets, while also facilitating exploitation and inconsistent enforcement. Existing statutes lack clear, workable mechanisms for large-scale compliance. IIDPA remedies these deficiencies through a rights-respecting framework designed to reduce unlawful presence by an estimated 20–40% over 10 years, measured by DHS’s Estimated Unauthorized Resident Population reports.  

Core Provisions  
- Enforcement Limitations: Requires reasonable suspicion of a criminal offense before detaining or requesting identification, and prohibits enforcement based on race, ethnicity, language, or perceived immigration status; incorporates Supreme Court limits on admissible evidence.  
- Disqualifying Offenses: Individuals convicted of aggravated felonies, crimes of violence, child exploitation offenses, sex-offender registration violations, drug trafficking, or terrorism are ineligible for all pathways.  
- Compliance Pathways (“Four Doors”):  
  - Door 1 — Enhanced Voluntary Departure: Biometric-verified departure with penalty waivers; no strike applied; one-time use.  
  - Door 2 — Residency Track: 4–8 years continuous residence, tax compliance, English proficiency; leads to conditional residency, LPR status, and eventual citizenship.  
  - Door 3 — Labor Integrity Track: Nationwide E-Verify phase-in, employer penalties/incentives, and a renewable 3-year Worker Compliance Visa allowing transition to Door 2.  
  - Door 4 — National Service Track: 4 years of military or civilian service (2,000 and 5,000 annual caps, adjustable) leading to conditional residency and fast-track naturalization.  
    Administration: USCIS oversees Doors 2/4; ICE manages Strike enforcement; DOL conducts labor audits.  
- Two-Strike System:  
  - Strike 1 (first post-enactment violation): Eligibility for voluntary departure or standard removal proceedings; 5-year bar from Doors 2–4.  
  - Strike 2 (second violation): Permanent ineligibility and re-entry bar, with a narrow humanitarian waiver.  
- Sunset Mechanism: Door 1 expires after 15 years; Doors 2–4 and the Strike system continue permanently.  
- Oversight and Appeals: Establishes an independent Inspector General for annual reporting; 30-day appeals process; penalties (including funding reductions) for systemic agency violations.  
- Border Security and Humanitarian Measures: Provides $5 billion for sensors, drones, data integration, and Border Patrol staffing/retention; includes family-unity waivers for Doors 2–4.  
- Fiscal Framework: Funded via penalties, fees, reallocations, and capped appropriations ($15–30 billion over the authorization period); complies with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act; requires a CBO score.  

Implementation and Safeguards  
The Act takes effect 180 days after enactment, with a 36-month transition period. Its provisions apply only prospectively, incorporate strict data-minimization standards, impose fraud penalties under INA §212(a)(6)(C), and include severability to preserve the overall statute.  

Expected Impacts  
IIDPA strengthens labor integrity, reduces unauthorized hiring, expands security vetting, and provides structured compliance options without mass deportations or broad amnesty. It upholds due process, targets serious offenders, and channels long-term residents into lawful, economically beneficial pathways. This balanced design positions the Act for potential bipartisan support by addressing enforcement, humanitarian, and fiscal concerns in a unified framework.
