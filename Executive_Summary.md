# Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA)
### One-Page Summary
Prepared by **Publius Redux**
---
## **Purpose**
The Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA) establishes a balanced, constitutional framework to reduce long-term unlawful presence, strengthen labor enforcement, protect civil liberties, and create lawful, orderly compliance pathways. It offers a practical alternative to both mass amnesty and mass deportation by combining enforcement, due process, and legal pathways.
---
## **Key Goals**
- Restore lawful immigration processes
- Reduce exploitation and unlawful hiring
- Protect constitutional rights during enforcement
- Provide clear, structured compliance options
- Strengthen border security and national security
- Modernize labor and service-based immigration mechanisms
---
## **Core Components**
### **1. Enforcement Limits & Civil Liberties**
- No detentions or ID demands without reasonable suspicion of a specific criminal offense
- Prohibits enforcement based on race, ethnicity, language, accent, or perceived status
- Evidence from egregious constitutional violations inadmissible in civil proceedings
- Mandatory DHS data-minimization standards
---
### **2. Disqualifying Offenses**
Ineligible for all pathways:
- Aggravated felonies
- Crimes of violence
- Child exploitation offenses
- Sex-offender registration violations
- Drug trafficking
- Terrorism-related offenses
---
## **3. Four Compliance Pathways (“Four Doors”)**
### **Door 1 — Enhanced Voluntary Departure**
- One-time, biometric-verified departure
- No removal order, no Strike, penalty waivers
- Preserves eligibility for legal re-entry
### **Door 2 — Residency Track**
- 4–8 years continuous presence, tax compliance, English proficiency
- Leads to Conditional Residency → LPR → citizenship eligibility
### **Door 3 — Labor Integrity Track**
- National E-Verify rollout (5-year phase-in)
- Employer incentives + penalties for systemic violations
- Worker Compliance Visa (WCV): 3-year renewable visa with pathway to Door 2
### **Door 4 — National Service Track**
- Military or civilian national service (4 years)
- Annual caps: 2,000 military / 5,000 civilian service placements
- Leads to LPR status and fast-track naturalization
---
## **4. Two-Strike System**
**Strike 1:**
- Triggered by first post-enactment unlawful entry/overstay
- 5-year bar from Doors 2–4
- Eligible for voluntary departure or full INA §240 proceedings
**Strike 2:**
- Permanent ineligibility for all Doors
- Permanent re-entry bar
- Full due-process hearing; limited humanitarian waiver
---
## **5. Border Security & Humanitarian Measures**
- $5B for sensors, drones, surveillance, data integration, Border Patrol staffing
- Family-unity waivers for Doors 2–4 (medical or dependent hardship)
- Annual reporting on encounters, backlogs, and unlawful-presence trends
---
## **6. Fiscal Framework**
- Funded through fees, penalties, DHS/DOL reallocations, and $15–30B capped appropriations
- Requires CBO score within 120 days
- No uncapped mandatory spending
---
## **Why IIDPA Works**
- Protects rights and restores lawful process
- Reduces unlawful presence sustainably
- Strengthens border and labor enforcement
- Offers realistic compliance options without mass deportation or blanket amnesty
- Delivers net fiscal savings through fees and tax compliance
- Designed for bipartisan consideration

Drafted and published under the pseudonym **Publius Redux**.# Executive Summary
## Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA)
### **Overview and Purpose**
The Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA) is a comprehensive immigration reform proposal addressing the estimated **11–14 million** individuals residing in the United States without lawful status. The Act establishes an orderly and constitutionally grounded framework for **compliance, departure, or enforcement**, while protecting civil liberties, enhancing national security, strengthening labor markets, and ensuring due process.
Rooted in Congress’s plenary authority and aligned with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), IIDPA avoids both mass amnesty and mass removal. Instead, it provides **four structured compliance pathways**, a **two-strike deterrence system**, and **rigorous oversight** designed to restore public trust and long-term stability.
---
### **Key Findings and Necessity**
Congress identifies that:
- Prolonged widespread unlawful presence places significant strain on border enforcement, immigration courts, detention systems, and labor markets.
- Existing statutory frameworks provide **no clear, scalable mechanisms** for long-term compliance.
- Unlawful presence fosters exploitation, inconsistent enforcement, and public distrust.
- A structured, rights-respecting system is needed to restore order and constitutional integrity.
IIDPA establishes a framework designed to reduce unlawful presence by an estimated **20–40% over 10 years**, measured through DHS’s Estimated Unauthorized Resident Population (EURP) reports (based on 2023 baseline estimates ranging from 11–14 million across sources like DHS, Pew Research, MPI, and CMS).
---
### **Core Provisions**
#### **Enforcement Limitations**
- Requires **reasonable suspicion of a criminal offense** before detention or ID requests.
- Prohibits enforcement based on **race, ethnicity, language, or perceived immigration status**.
- Incorporates Supreme Court limitations on admissible evidence.
#### **Disqualifying Offenses**
Individuals convicted of aggravated felonies, crimes of violence, child exploitation offenses, sex-offender registration violations, drug trafficking, or terrorism are **ineligible** for all compliance pathways.
---
### **Compliance Pathways (“Four Doors”)**
#### **Door 1 — Enhanced Voluntary Departure**
- Biometric-verified departure; penalty waivers; one-time use; no Strike applied.
#### **Door 2 — Residency Track**
- 4–8 years continuous residence, tax compliance, English proficiency.
- Leads to Conditional Residency → LPR → citizenship eligibility.
#### **Door 3 — Labor Integrity Track**
- Nationwide E-Verify phase-in with penalties and incentives.
- Creates a renewable 3-year **Worker Compliance Visa** (WCV) that transitions into Door 2.
#### **Door 4 — National Service Track**
- 4 years of military or civilian national service (2,000 and 5,000 annual caps, adjustable).
- Leads to Conditional Residency and fast-track naturalization.
**Administration:**
- USCIS administers Doors 2 and 4;
- ICE manages Strike enforcement;
- DOL conducts labor audits for Door 3.
---
### **Two-Strike System**
- **Strike 1:** First post-enactment violation → voluntary departure eligibility or INA §240 proceedings; 5-year bar from Doors 2–4.
- **Strike 2:** Second violation → permanent ineligibility and re-entry bar; narrow humanitarian waiver available.
---
### **Sunset Mechanism**
- Door 1 expires after **15 years**.
- Doors 2–4 and the Strike system continue permanently.
---
### **Oversight and Appeals**
- Establishes an independent **Immigration Integrity Inspector General** (IG).
- Requires annual reporting on systemic violations, fairness, and metrics.
- Provides a **30-day appeals process** for denials and strike assessments.
- Includes funding reduction penalties for systemic agency violations.
---
### **Border Security & Humanitarian Measures**
- Allocates **$5 billion** for sensors, drones, integrated data systems, and staffing/retention for Border Patrol.
- Includes family-unity waivers for Doors 2–4.
---
### **Fiscal Framework**
- Funded through **penalties, fees, reallocations**, and **capped appropriations** of $15–$30 billion.
- Complies with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.
- Requires a CBO score within 120 days of enactment.
---
### **Implementation and Safeguards**
- Takes effect **180 days** after enactment.
- Includes a **36-month transition period**.
- Applies prospectively only.
- Incorporates strict data-minimization standards.
- Imposes fraud penalties under INA §212(a)(6)(C).

### **Expected Impacts**
IIDPA:
- Strengthens labor integrity and reduces unauthorized hiring;
- Enhances national-security vetting;
- Provides structured, constitutional, non-amnesty compliance options;
- Prevents mass removals while restoring rule-of-law;
- Protects due process and targets serious offenders;
- Channels long-term residents into lawful, economically productive pathways.
Its balanced design provides a feasible, bipartisan pathway forward, addressing enforcement, humanitarian, and fiscal concerns in a unified, rights-respecting framework.
