# Executive Summary  
## Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA)

### **Overview and Purpose**
The Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA) is a comprehensive immigration reform proposal addressing the estimated **14–15.4 million** individuals residing in the United States without lawful status. The Act establishes an orderly and constitutionally grounded framework for **compliance, departure, or enforcement**, while protecting civil liberties, enhancing national security, strengthening labor markets, and ensuring due process.

Rooted in Congress’s plenary authority and aligned with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), IIDPA avoids both mass amnesty and mass removal. Instead, it provides **four structured compliance pathways**, a **two-strike deterrence system**, and **rigorous oversight** designed to restore public trust and long-term stability.

### **Key Findings and Necessity**
Congress identifies that:

- Prolonged widespread unlawful presence places significant strain on border enforcement, immigration courts, detention systems, and labor markets.  
- Existing statutory frameworks provide **no clear, scalable mechanisms** for long-term compliance.  
- Unlawful presence fosters exploitation, inconsistent enforcement, and public distrust.  
- A structured, rights-respecting system is needed to restore order and constitutional integrity.  

IIDPA establishes a framework designed to reduce unlawful presence by an estimated **20–40% over 10 years**, measured through DHS’s Estimated Unauthorized Resident Population (EURP) reports.

### **Core Provisions**

#### **Enforcement Limitations**
- Requires **reasonable suspicion of a criminal offense** before detention or ID requests.  
- Prohibits enforcement based on **race, ethnicity, language, or perceived immigration status**.  
- Incorporates Supreme Court limitations on admissible evidence.

#### **Disqualifying Offenses**
Individuals convicted of aggravated felonies, crimes of violence, child exploitation offenses, sex-offender registration violations, drug trafficking, or terrorism are **ineligible** for all compliance pathways.

---

### **Compliance Pathways (“Four Doors”)**

#### **Door 1 — Enhanced Voluntary Departure**
- Biometric-verified departure; penalty waivers; one-time use; no Strike applied.

#### **Door 2 — Residency Track**
- 4–8 years continuous residence, tax compliance, English proficiency.  
- Leads to Conditional Residency → LPR → citizenship eligibility.

#### **Door 3 — Labor Integrity Track**
- Nationwide E-Verify phase-in with penalties and incentives.  
- Creates a renewable 3-year **Worker Compliance Visa** (WCV) that transitions into Door 2.

#### **Door 4 — National Service Track**
- 4 years of military or civilian national service (2,000 and 5,000 annual caps, adjustable).  
- Leads to Conditional Residency and fast-track naturalization.

**Administration:**  
- USCIS administers Doors 2 and 4;  
- ICE manages Strike enforcement;  
- DOL conducts labor audits for Door 3.

---

### **Two-Strike System**
- **Strike 1:** First post-enactment violation → voluntary departure eligibility or INA §240 proceedings; 5-year bar from Doors 2–4.  
- **Strike 2:** Second violation → permanent ineligibility and re-entry bar; narrow humanitarian waiver available.

---

### **Sunset Mechanism**
- Door 1 expires after **15 years**.  
- Doors 2–4 and the Strike system continue permanently.

---

### **Oversight and Appeals**
- Establishes an independent **Immigration Integrity Inspector General** (IG).  
- Requires annual reporting on systemic violations, fairness, and metrics.  
- Provides a **30-day appeals process** for denials and strike assessments.  
- Includes funding reduction penalties for systemic agency violations.

---

### **Border Security & Humanitarian Measures**
- Allocates **$5 billion** for sensors, drones, integrated data systems, and staffing/retention for Border Patrol.  
- Includes family-unity waivers for Doors 2–4.  

---

### **Fiscal Framework**
- Funded through **penalties, fees, reallocations**, and **capped appropriations** of $15–$30 billion.  
- Complies with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.  
- Requires a CBO score within 120 days of enactment.

---

### **Implementation and Safeguards**
- Takes effect **180 days** after enactment.  
- Includes a **36-month transition period**.  
- Applies prospectively only.  
- Incorporates strict data-minimization standards.  
- Imposes fraud penalties under INA §212(a)(6)(C).  
- Includes severability to preserve the statute.

---

### **Expected Impacts**
IIDPA:

- Strengthens labor integrity and reduces unauthorized hiring;  
- Enhances national-security vetting;  
- Provides structured, constitutional, non-amnesty compliance options;  
- Prevents mass removals while restoring rule-of-law;  
- Protects due process and targets serious offenders;  
- Channels long-term residents into lawful, economically productive pathways.

Its balanced design provides a feasible, bipartisan pathway forward, addressing enforcement, humanitarian, and fiscal concerns in a unified, rights-respecting framework.
