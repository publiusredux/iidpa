### One-Page Summary  
Prepared by **Publius Redux**

---

## **Purpose**
The Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA) establishes a balanced, constitutional framework to reduce long-term unlawful presence, strengthen labor enforcement, protect civil liberties, and create lawful, orderly compliance pathways. It offers a practical alternative to both mass amnesty and mass deportation by combining enforcement, due process, and legal pathways.

---

## **Key Goals**
- Restore lawful immigration processes  
- Reduce exploitation and unlawful hiring  
- Protect constitutional rights during enforcement  
- Provide clear, structured compliance options  
- Strengthen border security and national security  
- Modernize labor and service-based immigration mechanisms  

---

## **Core Components**

### **1. Enforcement Limits & Civil Liberties**
- No detentions or ID demands without reasonable suspicion of a specific criminal offense  
- Prohibits enforcement based on race, ethnicity, language, accent, or perceived status  
- Evidence from egregious constitutional violations inadmissible in civil proceedings  
- Mandatory DHS data-minimization standards  

---

### **2. Disqualifying Offenses**
Ineligible for all pathways:  
- Aggravated felonies  
- Crimes of violence  
- Child exploitation offenses  
- Sex-offender registration violations  
- Drug trafficking  
- Terrorism-related offenses  

---

## **3. Four Compliance Pathways (“Four Doors”)**

### **Door 1 — Enhanced Voluntary Departure**
- One-time, biometric-verified departure  
- No removal order, no Strike, penalty waivers  
- Preserves eligibility for legal re-entry  

### **Door 2 — Residency Track**
- 4–8 years continuous presence, tax compliance, English proficiency  
- Leads to Conditional Residency → LPR → citizenship eligibility  

### **Door 3 — Labor Integrity Track**
- National E-Verify rollout (5-year phase-in)  
- Employer incentives + penalties for systemic violations  
- Worker Compliance Visa (WCV): 3-year renewable visa with pathway to Door 2  

### **Door 4 — National Service Track**
- Military or civilian national service (4 years)  
- Annual caps: 2,000 military / 5,000 civilian service placements  
- Leads to LPR status and fast-track naturalization  

---

## **4. Two-Strike System**
**Strike 1:**  
- Triggered by first post-enactment unlawful entry/overstay  
- 5-year bar from Doors 2–4  
- Eligible for voluntary departure or full INA §240 proceedings  

**Strike 2:**  
- Permanent ineligibility for all Doors  
- Permanent re-entry bar  
- Full due-process hearing; limited humanitarian waiver  

---

## **5. Border Security & Humanitarian Measures**
- $5B for sensors, drones, surveillance, data integration, Border Patrol staffing  
- Family-unity waivers for Doors 2–4 (medical or dependent hardship)  
- Annual reporting on encounters, backlogs, and unlawful-presence trends  

---

## **6. Fiscal Framework**
- Funded through fees, penalties, DHS/DOL reallocations, and $15–30B capped appropriations  
- Requires CBO score within 120 days  
- No uncapped mandatory spending  

---

## **Why IIDPA Works**
- Protects rights and restores lawful process  
- Reduces unlawful presence sustainably
- Strengthens border and labor enforcement
- Offers realistic compliance options without mass deportation or blanket amnesty
- Delivers net fiscal savings through fees and tax compliance
- Designed for bipartisan consideration
