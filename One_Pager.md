**Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA) – One-Pager**  

**Problem**: An estimated 14–15.4 million individuals reside in the U.S. without lawful status, straining enforcement, courts, labor markets, and public services. Existing laws lack clear, constitutional pathways, leading to inconsistency, exploitation, and eroded trust.  

**Solution**: IIDPA creates a structured, rights-respecting framework with four compliance "Doors," a two-strike deterrence system, enhanced security, and oversight—avoiding mass amnesty or deportations while aligning with INA and constitutional standards.  

**Key Components**:  
- **Enforcement Protections**: No stops based on race/ethnicity/perceived status; requires criminal suspicion; excludes bad-faith evidence (per Supreme Court precedent).  
- **Disqualifications**: Bars serious offenders (aggravated felonies, violence, child crimes, drug trafficking, terrorism).  
- **Data Privacy**: Strict minimization standards for collected information, limiting use to adjudication, fraud prevention, and security.  
- **Four Doors for Compliance**:  
  - **Door 1**: Voluntary departure with waivers; no strike.  
  - **Door 2**: 4–8 year residency track to LPR/citizenship via taxes, English, reporting.  
  - **Door 3**: E-Verify rollout; 3-year work visa with employer incentives/penalties.  
  - **Door 4**: National service (military/civilian) for fast-track status (capped/adjustable).  
- **Two-Strike System**: Strike 1 = voluntary departure eligibility + 5-year bar; Strike 2 = permanent ineligibility (humanitarian waiver possible). Strikes apply prospectively only.  
- **Sunset & Oversight**: Door 1 ends after 15 years; IG reports track 20–40% reduction; appeals and agency penalties ensure fairness.  
- **Border/Humanitarian**: $5B for tech, agents, data; family waivers.  
- **Fiscal**: $15–30B capped funding via penalties/fees/reallocations; CBO-required; no unfunded mandates.  

**Implementation**: Effective 180 days post-enactment; 36-month transition; prospective only; data privacy/fraud safeguards.  

**Benefits**:  
- **Security/Labor**: Reduces unauthorized work; vets via biometrics.  
- **Humanitarian**: Due process; pathways for long-term residents.  
- **Bipartisan Appeal**: Enforcement for conservatives; rights/protections for progressives; fiscal controls for all. Could build coalition among moderates focused on orderly reform.  
- **Impact**: Orderly resolution, economic contributions, reduced unlawful presence.
