## **I. Overview**

This simulated analysis approximates how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) might evaluate the fiscal impact of the Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA) over a standard 10-year budget window (FY2026–2035).  
The estimate uses conservative assumptions drawn from historical CBO analyses of immigration legislation, DHS operational data, and federal cost models for visa processing, enforcement, and workforce programs.

IIDPA is expected to produce **a neutral to modestly positive net budget impact**, with most costs occurring in the first 5 years and most revenue gains emerging in years 3–10.

## **II. Key Baseline Assumptions**

- **Participation Rates:** 30–50% uptake across Doors 1–4, consistent with voluntary departure and legalization participation rates seen in prior programs.  
- **Population Scope:** Several million unauthorized individuals currently reside in the United States; precise counts vary in federal estimates.  
- **Timeframe:** 10-year scoring window (FY2026–2035).  
- **Economic Effects:** Increased legal workforce participation yields higher payroll-tax revenue and GDP output.  
- **Offsets:** Application fees, penalties, and tax compliance contribute to revenue.  
- **Savings:** Improved enforcement consistency, reduced backlogs, and reduced unlawful presence lower state and federal service burdens over time.

## **III. Estimated Federal Outlays (Costs)**

### **1. E-Verify Expansion & Labor Integrity Systems (Door 3)**  
- 5-year national phase-in, technology upgrades, audits  
- **Estimated Cost:** **$10–15B** over 10 years

### **2. Border Security & Technology Investments (Section 12)**  
- Sensors, drones, surveillance, data integration, staffing  
- **Estimated Cost:** **$8–10B** over 10 years

### **3. National Service Pathway (Door 4)**  
- Civilian and military program administration  
- **Estimated Cost:** **$6–7B** over 10 years

### **4. Processing Capacity, Adjudications & Appeals (Doors 2–4, Section 8)**  
- USCIS, ICE, IG oversight, digital case systems  
- **Estimated Cost:** **$10B** over 10 years

### **5. Transition & Contingency Funding (36-Month Ramp-Up)**  
- Infrastructure, staffing, public-facing systems  
- **Estimated Cost:** **$5B** one-time

### **Total Estimated Direct Costs:**  
### **$39–47B** (primarily discretionary)

## **IV. Estimated Revenues & Offsets**

### **1. Penalties & Fees**  
Includes:  
- Door applications  
- Worker Compliance Visa fees  
- E-Verify violation penalties  
- Civil penalties for systemic employer violations  
- **Estimated Revenue:** **$10–15B**

### **2. Tax Compliance & Payroll Revenue (Doors 2 & 3)**  
- Increased withholding from legalized employment  
- Back-tax payments and installment agreements  
- **Estimated Revenue:** **$15–25B**

### **3. GDP & Labor-Market Growth Effects**  
- Expanded legal workforce participation  
- Modeled at ~0.1–0.2% annual GDP increase (aligned with prior CBO analyses of immigration bills)  
- **Estimated Revenue:** **$5–10B**

### **4. Savings from Reduced Unlawful Presence**  
- Lower emergency service demand  
- More efficient enforcement  
- Reduced detention and court backlogs  
- **Estimated Savings:** **$5–10B**

### **Total Estimated Revenues/Savings:**  
### **$35–60B**

## **V. Net Deficit Impact**

**Projected Net Effect (10-year window):**  
### **–$1B to –$13B (deficit reduction)**  
IIDPA is expected to be deficit-neutral to modestly deficit-reducing over 10 years due to substantial offsets from fees, penalties, increased tax compliance, and economic growth.

### **PAYGO Impact:**  
- **Likely neutral or positive**, depending on participation rates and economic conditions.  
- Mandatory spending exposure is minimal due to statutory funding caps.

### **Dynamic Scoring Considerations:**  
Including GDP effects:  
- Additional **$10–20B** in federal revenue is plausible but uncertain.  
- Participation and enforcement efficacy are the largest variables affecting outcomes.

---

## **VI. Uncertainty & Sensitivity Notes**

- **Higher participation** → more revenue + more processing costs  
- **Lower participation** → lower revenue + lower processing costs  
- **Higher enforcement compliance** → fewer penalties, but more payroll revenue  
- **Economic downturn** → reduces revenue estimates  
- **Technology/implementation delays** → may shift upfront costs into later years

CBO would refine these assumptions using classified, agency-submitted operational data and dynamic microsimulation models.

## **VII. Comparison to Prior Scored Bills**

IIDPA’s fiscal profile aligns with immigration bills that combine enforcement modernization with legal pathways (e.g., 2023 cross-party proposals).  
Compared to these bills:

- IIDPA has **stronger built-in revenue sources** (penalties, WCV, labor enforcement).  
- Spending is capped and heavily discretionary.  
- Compliance pathways generate tax revenue earlier in the scoring window.

---

### **Conclusion**  
Under standard scoring assumptions, IIDPA is expected to:  
- Produce **a neutral or positive deficit impact**,  
- Modernize immigration enforcement efficiently,  
- Expand legal workforce participation, and  
- Reduce long-term unlawful presence with limited fiscal risk.
