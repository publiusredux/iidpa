#### Simulated CBO Score Outline
**Simulated CBO Score Outline: Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA)**  

This is a mock analysis modeled on CBO scoring of similar bills (e.g., the Dignity Act of 2023, which estimated $20–40B over 10 years for pathways, enforcement, and border tech). It uses conservative assumptions based on DHS/Federal Register data, Pew/MPI estimates, and fiscal impacts from E-Verify phase-ins and visa programs. Actual CBO scoring would involve detailed modeling; this is for illustrative purposes only.  

**Baseline Assumptions**:  
- Unauthorized population: 14–15.4 million (Pew 2023/CIS 2025 estimates).  
- Participation: 30–50% opt into Doors (based on historical voluntary departure/visa uptake rates).  
- Timeframe: 10-year window (FY2026–2035), per standard CBO practice.  
- Revenue offsets: Penalties/fees from E-Verify violations and applications; tax compliance from Door 2/3.  
- Savings: Reduced unlawful presence lowers strain on public services (e.g., emergency healthcare, education); increased legal workforce boosts GDP/tax revenue.  

**Estimated Costs (Direct Spending/Authorizations)**:  
- **E-Verify Phase-In (Door 3)**: $5B over 5 years for implementation/pilots; ongoing $1B/year post-phase-in (tech, audits, DOL coordination). Total: $10–15B.  
- **Border Resources (Section 11)**: $5B one-time allocation for tech/personnel; $500M/year maintenance. Total: $8–10B.  
- **Civilian/Military Service (Door 4)**: $5B for placements (up to 5,000/year); DoD/DHS admin costs $200M/year. Total: $6–7B.  
- **Processing/Appeals/IG (Sections 4, 8)**: $5B for USCIS/ICE capacity; $5B for IG/oversight. Total: $10B.  
- **Contingency/Transition**: $5B buffer for 36-month ramp-up.  
- **Gross Costs**: $39–47B (primarily discretionary appropriations; minimal mandatory spending).  

**Estimated Revenues/Offsets**:  
- **Penalties/Fees**: E-Verify fines ($1K–$10K/violation, inflation-adjusted); application fees for Doors (~$500–1,000/person, per INA models). Projected: $10–15B (assuming 20–30% employer compliance violations initially).  
- **Tax Compliance (Doors 2/3)**: Back taxes/installments from 4–6 million participants; increased payroll taxes from legalized work. Estimated: $15–25B (based on IRS data from similar programs).  
- **Economic Growth**: Legalized workforce adds ~0.1–0.2% annual GDP growth (per CBO analogs); higher tax receipts $5–10B.  
- **Savings from Reduced Unlawful Presence**: 20–40% drop lowers federal/state aid costs (e.g., $5–10B in healthcare/education savings, per MPI models).  
- **Net Revenues/Savings**: $35–60B.  

**Net Fiscal Impact**:  
- **Deficit Effect**: Net savings of $1–13B over 10 years (revenues/savings exceed costs due to offsets).  
- **PAYGO Score**: Neutral to positive (no unlimited mandatory spending; complies with rules).  
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Including GDP effects, potential $10–20B additional revenue from labor market integration.  
- **Uncertainty**: High—depends on participation rates, enforcement efficacy, and economic conditions. Lower uptake could increase costs; higher compliance boosts savings.  

**Comparison to Similar Bills**: Aligns with Dignity Act (CBO: $25B net cost pre-offsets) but with stronger revenue from strikes/E-Verify. Full CBO review (required within 120 days) would refine based on detailed models.

#### 5. Talking Points
**Talking Points: Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA)**  

**Introduction/Overview**  
- "IIDPA tackles the 14–15.4 million unauthorized residents in the U.S. by creating an orderly, constitutional framework for compliance or departure—balancing enforcement, due process, and pathways without mass amnesty or deportations."  
- "Rooted in existing INA laws, it aims to cut unlawful presence by 20–40% over 10 years through structured 'Doors,' strikes, and oversight, while boosting security and labor integrity."  

**Core Features**  
- **Four Doors for Compliance**: "Options include voluntary exit (Door 1, no penalties), residency track (Door 2, 4–8 years to LPR), work visa with E-Verify (Door 3), or national service (Door 4, fast-track naturalization)—all with biometrics, taxes, and English requirements."  
- **Two-Strike Deterrence**: "First violation triggers voluntary departure eligibility and firm bar; second means permanent ineligibility—applied prospectively with humanitarian waivers."  
- **Enforcement Safeguards**: "No racial profiling; requires criminal suspicion for stops; data privacy via minimization standards."  
- **Border and Oversight**: "$5B for tech, agents, and metrics; independent IG ensures fairness with appeals and agency penalties."  
- **Fiscal Controls**: "Capped at $15–30B, funded by fees/penalties; CBO scoring required—net savings projected at $1–13B over 10 years."  

**Bipartisan Strengths**  
- "Conservatives: Strong E-Verify, strikes, and border funding prioritize accountability and security."  
- "Progressives: Due process, family waivers, and humane pathways emphasize fairness."  
- "Moderates: Practical phase-in, economic boosts from legal work, and no unfunded mandates make it workable."  

**Addressing Objections**  
- **"Isn't this amnesty?"**: "No—eligibility is earned through compliance, disqualifies criminals, and imposes strikes for violations; it's structured reform, not blanket relief."  
- **"Too expensive?"**: "Capped funding with offsets from taxes/fees; modeled on scored bills like Dignity Act—delivers net savings via reduced unlawful presence and growth."  
- **"Weak enforcement?"**: "Nationwide E-Verify, biometrics, and permanent bars for repeaters strengthen the system without overreach."  
- **"Border ignored?"**: "Directs $5B to tech/personnel; requires annual reporting on encounters/backlogs."  
- **"Family impacts?"**: "Prioritizes waivers for U.S.-citizen dependents and hardships; focuses on unity."  

**Call to Action**  
- "IIDPA restores order humanely—let's explore co-sponsorship, amendments, or a hearing to advance it."
