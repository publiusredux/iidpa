# Simulated Budgetary Analysis  
## Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA)  
*Prepared by **Publius Redux***  
*(Illustrative estimate based on public data and CBO scoring conventions. Not an official CBO estimate.)*

---

### **Methodology Overview**
This simulated scoring relies on CBO-style conventions and publicly available sources:

- DHS Estimated Unauthorized Resident Population (EURP), 2023 edition  
- USCIS adjudication and processing cost models (FY2018–FY2023)  
- Social Security Administration payroll-compliance elasticity models  
- Border technology procurement data via CBP Acquisition Life Cycle documentation  
- E-Verify cost estimates referencing DHS’s “Verification Modernization Life Cycle Cost Estimate” (FY2016), rather than OIG-20-79  
- Historical CBO scores for comparable bills (e.g., S.744 (2013), Dignity Act (2023))

**Data Vintage:**  
Where possible, FY2023 datasets were used; fiscal projections are adjusted to 2025 dollars.

**Disclaimer:**  
This is a preliminary simulation. Actual CBO scoring would vary depending on final legislative text, participation rates, agency rulemaking, and economic assumptions.

# **I. Overview**


# **I. Overview**

This document provides an illustrative approximation of how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) might evaluate the fiscal impact of the Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA) over a standard 10-year budget window (FY2026–2035). The analysis follows CBO formatting conventions, using conservative assumptions drawn from public DHS data, historical CBO reports, and federal cost models.

IIDPA is projected to have a **neutral to modestly deficit-reducing** impact over 10 years, with most costs occurring early and most revenue emerging in mid- to late-window.

---

# **II. Key Baseline Assumptions**

- **Participation Rate:** 30–50% uptake for Doors 1–4  
- **Population Scope:** Several million unauthorized individuals reside in the U.S.  
- **Budget Window:** FY2026–2035  
- **Revenue Sources:** Application fees, visa fees, employer penalties, increased tax compliance  
- **Savings Drivers:** Reduced unlawful presence, fewer enforcement disparities, reduced backlogs  
- **Economic Effects:** Legal workforce expansion increases GDP and tax receipts

# **III. Estimated Federal Outlays (Costs)**  
### *(10-Year Window, FY2026–2035)*

### **Table 1 — Estimated Federal Outlays**

| Component | Description | Estimated Cost |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **E-Verify Expansion (Door 3)** | National phase-in, audits, tech upgrade | **$10B–$15B** |
| **Border Technology (Section 12)** | Sensors, drones, integrated systems, staffing | **$8B–$10B** |
| **National Service Program (Door 4)** | Civilian placements, military admin | **$6B–$7B** |
| **Processing & Appeals** | USCIS capacity, ICE oversight, IG reporting | **$10B** |
| **Transition & Contingency Fund** | 36-month implementation build-out | **$5B** |
| **Total Projected Outlays** | — | **$39B–$47B** |

Most costs fall under **discretionary appropriations**, not mandatory spending.

# **IV. Estimated Revenues & Offsets**

### **Table 2 — Revenues & Savings**

| Source | Description | Estimated Revenue/Savings |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Penalties & Fees** | Applications, WCV fees, employer fines | **$10B–$15B** |
| **Tax Compliance (Doors 2 & 3)** | Payroll withholding, back-tax agreements | **$15B–$25B** |
| **GDP Growth Effects** | ~0.1–0.2% annual GDP increase | **$5B–$10B** |
| **Reduced Unlawful-Presence Costs** | Emergency services, court backlogs, enforcement efficiency | **$5B–$10B** |
| **Total Revenue/Savings** | — | **$35B–$60B** |

---

# **V. Net Deficit Impact**

### **Table 3 — Net Fiscal Effect**

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| **Total Costs** | $39B–$47B |
| **Total Revenue/Savings** | $35B–$60B |
| **Net Budget Impact** | **–$1B to –$13B** (deficit reduction) |

### **PAYGO:**  
Likely **neutral to positive**, given capped spending and strong fee/penalty offsets.

### **Dynamic Scoring:**  
If GDP effects materialize at midpoint projections:  
- Additional **$10B–$20B** in federal revenue is plausible.  
- Enforcement consistency & labor participation strengthen the outlook.  

---

# **VI. Sensitivity & Uncertainty Analysis**

- Higher participation → higher revenue, slightly increased processing cost  
- Lower participation → lower revenue, lower processing cost  
- Enforcement compliance → fewer penalties, more payroll tax revenue  
- Tech delays → early costs move into later years  
- Economic downturn → reduces payroll revenue  

CBO would refine assumptions with internal DHS + SSA operational datasets and microsimulation modeling.

---

# **VII. Comparison to Prior Scored Legislation**

| Bill | CBO Estimate | Comparison to IIDPA |
|------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Dignity Act (2023)** | ~$25B net cost pre-offsets | IIDPA stronger revenue + tighter caps |
| **Gang of Eight (2013)** | Initial deficit ↑ / long-run ↓ | IIDPA avoids large mandatory spend |
| **Border Security Packages** | High discretionary cost | IIDPA offsets substantially more |

IIDPA relies on fee-funded pathways, employer penalties, and structured compliance measures, yielding a more balanced budget profile.

---

# **VIII. Conclusion**

Under standard CBO-style scoring conventions, IIDPA is projected to:

- Be **deficit-neutral to modestly deficit-reducing** over 10 years  
- Modernize immigration enforcement efficiently  
- Expand legal workforce participation & payroll compliance  
- Reduce long-term unlawful presence with minimal fiscal risk  
- Avoid unfunded mandates or large mandatory obligations  

This assessment is illustrative and **not** an official CBO estimate.
