## **I. Overview**

This simulated analysis approximates how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) might evaluate the fiscal impact of the Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA) over a standard 10-year budget window (FY2026–2035).  
The estimate uses conservative assumptions drawn from historical CBO analyses of immigration legislation, DHS operational data, and federal cost models for visa processing, enforcement, and workforce programs.

IIDPA is expected to produce **a neutral to modestly positive net budget impact**, with most costs occurring in the first 5 years and most revenue gains emerging in years 3–10.

## **II. Key Baseline Assumptions**

- **Participation Rates:** 30–50% uptake across Doors 1–4, consistent with voluntary departure and legalization participation rates seen in prior programs.  
- **Population Scope:** Several million unauthorized individuals currently reside in the United States; precise counts vary in federal estimates.  
- **Timeframe:** 10-year scoring window (FY2026–2035).  
- **Economic Effects:** Increased legal workforce participation yields higher payroll-tax revenue and GDP output.  
- **Offsets:** Application fees, penalties, and tax compliance contribute to revenue.  
- **Savings:** Improved enforcement consistency, reduced backlogs, and reduced unlawful presence lower state and federal service burdens over time.
