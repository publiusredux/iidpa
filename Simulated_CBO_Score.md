# Simulated Budgetary Analysis
## Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA)
*Prepared by **Publius Redux***  
*(Illustrative estimate based on public data and CBO scoring conventions. Not an official CBO estimate.)*
---
### **Methodology Overview**
This simulated scoring relies on CBO-style conventions and publicly available sources:  
- DHS Estimated Unauthorized Resident Population (EURP), 2023 edition  
- USCIS adjudication and processing cost models (FY2018–FY2023)  
- Social Security Administration payroll-compliance elasticity models  
- Border technology procurement data via CBP Acquisition Life Cycle documentation  
- E-Verify cost estimates referencing DHS’s “Verification Modernization Life Cycle Cost Estimate” (FY2016), rather than OIG-20-79  
- Historical CBO scores for comparable bills (e.g., S.744 (2013), Dignity Act (2023))  

**Data Vintage:**  
Where possible, FY2023 datasets were used; fiscal projections are adjusted to 2025 dollars.  

**Disclaimer:**  
This is a preliminary simulation.
