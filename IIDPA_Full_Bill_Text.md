SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; PURPOSE; FINDINGS; DEFINITIONS
1.1 Short Title

This Act may be cited as the “Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act” or “IIDPA.”

1.2 Purpose

The purpose of this Act is to:

Establish a lawful and orderly immigration compliance system;

Protect individual rights under the Constitution;

Enhance national security and public safety;

Strengthen labor integrity and reduce unlawful employment;

Provide clear pathways for compliance; and

Apply firm, fair consequences for repeated unlawful entry or overstays.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall administer and enforce this Act consistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including §103.

1.3 Findings

Congress finds that:

Several million individuals currently reside in the United States without lawful status, contributing to significant strain on border enforcement, immigration courts, detention capacity, and labor markets;

Existing statutes lack clear, workable mechanisms for large-scale compliance;

Prolonged unlawful presence fosters exploitation, inconsistent enforcement, and diminished public trust;

Mass amnesty and mass removal are neither operationally feasible nor consistent with constitutional values;

A structured, rights-respecting statutory framework is necessary to restore order, enhance security, strengthen labor enforcement, and uphold constitutional protections;

Congress possesses plenary authority over immigration under the Constitution.

1.4 Constitutional Enforcement Standards

All persons within the United States are protected by constitutional guarantees, including the Fourth Amendment;

No officer may detain, question, or compel identification absent objective, articulable reasonable suspicion of a specific criminal offense;

Race, ethnicity, national origin, language, accent, appearance alone, or perceived immigration status shall not constitute reasonable suspicion;

Enforcement under this Act shall comply with constitutional precedent;

Nothing herein creates a new cause of action beyond existing constitutional law.

1.5 Definitions

For purposes of this Act:

Unlawful presence: Presence without lawful status under the INA;

Minor civil immigration violation: Overstay or lapse <180 days with no fraud or criminal conduct;

Disqualifying offense: Any offense listed in Section 3;

Compliance window: 180-day period from application;

English proficiency: As used for naturalization, with hardship waivers;

Worker Compliance Visa (WCV): Temporary renewable visa created under this Act;

Conditional Residency (CR): Temporary lawful status granted under a Door pathway;

Enhanced voluntary departure: Voluntary exit pathway under Door 1;

Strike: Civil immigration penalty under Section 5;

Due process: Notice, hearing, right to counsel at no cost to the government, and appeal;

Systemic violation: Three or more violations of Section 1.4 in 12 months, confirmed by IG or adjudication;

Substantiated complaint: Verified through administrative determination or IG findings.

SECTION 2. ENFORCEMENT LIMITATIONS
2.1 Requirements for Stops and Identification

No officer may detain, stop, or compel identification absent reasonable suspicion of a specific criminal offense. Immigration status alone is insufficient.
This does not modify border-checkpoint authority under 8 U.S.C. §1357(a)(3).

Officers may not use the following as bases for stops or questioning:

Race;

Ethnicity;

National origin;

Evidence obtained in egregious or bad-faith violations of this Section is inadmissible in civil immigration proceedings, consistent with INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032 (1984).
