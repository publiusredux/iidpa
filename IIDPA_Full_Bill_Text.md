# **SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; PURPOSE; FINDINGS; DEFINITIONS**

## **1.1 Short Title**
This Act may be cited as the **“Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act”** or **“IIDPA.”**

---

## **1.2 Purpose**
The purpose of this Act is to:

- Establish a lawful and orderly immigration compliance system;  
- Protect individual rights under the Constitution;  
- Enhance national security and public safety;  
- Strengthen labor integrity and reduce unlawful employment;  
- Provide clear pathways for compliance; and  
- Apply firm, fair consequences for repeated unlawful entry or overstays.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall administer and enforce this Act consistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including §103.

---

## **1.3 Findings**
Congress finds that:

1. Several million individuals currently reside in the United States without lawful status, contributing to strain on border enforcement, immigration courts, detention capacity, and labor markets;  
2. Existing statutes lack clear, workable mechanisms for large-scale compliance;  
3. Prolonged unlawful presence fosters exploitation, inconsistent enforcement, and diminished public trust;  
4. Mass amnesty and mass removal are neither feasible nor consistent with constitutional values;  
5. A structured, rights-respecting statutory framework is necessary to restore order and uphold constitutional protections;  
6. Congress possesses plenary authority over immigration.

---

## **1.4 Constitutional Enforcement Standards**
- All persons within the U.S. are protected by constitutional guarantees, including the Fourth Amendment;  
- No officer may detain, question, or compel identification absent **objective, articulable reasonable suspicion** of a specific criminal offense;  
- Race, ethnicity, national origin, language, accent, appearance alone, or perceived immigration status do **not** constitute reasonable suspicion;  
- Enforcement must follow constitutional precedent;  
- Nothing herein creates a new cause of action beyond existing constitutional law.

---
