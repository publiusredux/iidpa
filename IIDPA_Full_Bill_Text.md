**SECTION 1. PURPOSE, FINDINGS, PRINCIPLES, AND DEFINITIONS**  
1.1 Purpose  
This Act establishes a lawful, orderly immigration framework that protects individual rights under the Constitution, enhances national security, strengthens labor integrity, ensures due process, and provides clear pathways for compliance while imposing firm, fair consequences for repeated violations, consistent with the plenary power of Congress over immigration.  
DHS shall have authority to administer, implement, and enforce this Act consistent with INA §103.  

1.2 Congressional Findings and National Necessity  
Congress finds that:  
1. An estimated 14 million individuals (Pew Research, Aug. 21, 2025) to 15.4 million individuals (non-governmental estimate, CIS January 2025) currently reside in the United States without lawful status;  
2. This prolonged condition places significant strain on federal, state, and local systems, including border enforcement, immigration courts, detention infrastructure, labor markets, and public services;  
3. Existing statutory frameworks fail to provide clear, constitutional mechanisms for compliance or departure, contributing to exploitation, inconsistent enforcement, and diminished public confidence;  
4. Piecemeal or exclusively punitive approaches are incapable of resolving a population of this scale;  
5. A comprehensive, structured, rights-respecting statutory reform is required to restore order, reduce long-term unlawful presence, enhance security, and uphold constitutional protections, consistent with the plenary power doctrine and INA §§103, 212, and 237.  

1.3 Constitutional Enforcement Standards  
1. All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States possess constitutional rights, including protection from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment;  
2. No officer may detain, question, or demand identification absent objective, articulable reasonable suspicion of a specific criminal offense;  
3. Race; ethnicity; national origin; accent or language ability; physical characteristics such as appearance alone; and perceived immigration status shall never constitute reasonable suspicion;  
4. All enforcement actions under this Act are bound by these constitutional limits, consistent with existing Supreme Court precedent.  
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to create any right of action beyond those recognized under existing constitutional law.  

1.4 Definitions  
For purposes of this Act:  
1. Unlawful presence: Presence without lawful status under the INA;  
2. Minor civil immigration violation: Overstay or lapse <180 days with no fraud or criminal conduct;  
3. Disqualifying offense: Any offense listed in Section 3;  
4. Compliance window: 180-day period from application;  
5. English proficiency: Standard used for naturalization testing; waivable for age, disability, hardship;  
6. Worker Compliance Visa (WCV): Temporary renewable visa created under this Act (amending INA §101(a)(15));  
7. Conditional Residency (CR): Temporary lawful status contingent on compliance with a Door;  
8. Enhanced voluntary departure: Departure pathway under Door 1 with penalty waiver (distinct from INA §240B);  
9. Strike: Civil penalty assessed under Section 5;  
10. Due process: Notice, opportunity for hearing, right to counsel (at own expense), and right to appeal under Section 8;  
11. Systemic violation: Three or more violations of Section 1.3 within a 12-month period by an agency, confirmed by IG, substantiated complaints, or verified court rulings;  
12. Extreme case (Strike 2 waiver): DHS-verified humanitarian hardship, including U.S.-citizen dependents, medical emergency, or comparable necessity, established by clear and convincing evidence with supporting documentation;  
13. Alternative civilian service: Service through federally authorized programs such as AmeriCorps or equivalent national-service partners;  
14. Small employer: Fewer than 50 employees, aggregated across commonly owned or controlled entities per 26 U.S.C. §414(b)–(c);  
15. Labor integrity: Fair employment practices, reduced unauthorized hiring, and worker protections;  
16. Violation (for systemic purposes): Confirmed by IG, substantiated complaints (defined as one verified through administrative determination or IG investigative findings under a preponderance of the evidence standard), or verified court rulings;  
17. Substantiated complaint: A complaint verified through administrative determination or IG investigative findings under a preponderance of the evidence standard;  
18. Fraudulent application: Fraudulent applications or submissions under this Act shall be subject to penalties under INA §212(a)(6)(C), with enhanced biometric verification required for all Doors to detect identity fraud.  

**SECTION 2. ENFORCEMENT LIMITATIONS**  
2.1 Requirements for Stops and Identification  
No officer may detain or compel identification absent reasonable suspicion of a specific criminal offense.

2.4 Data Privacy Standards
