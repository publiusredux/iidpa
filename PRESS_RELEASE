# Citizen Author “Publius Redux” Releases the Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA) — A Comprehensive, Rights-Respecting Blueprint for U.S. Immigration Reform

**WASHINGTON, D.C. —** Independent policy writer *Publius Redux* today released the **Immigration Integrity and Due Process Act (IIDPA)**, a full legislative framework designed to restore order to the U.S. immigration system while upholding constitutional rights, strengthening labor enforcement, and providing structured compliance pathways.

The proposal offers a **balanced alternative** to mass amnesty or mass deportations, delivering clarity, accountability, and due-process protections.

> **“Americans deserve an immigration system that is both firm and fair — one that enforces the law without abandoning the Constitution,”** said Publius Redux.  
> **“IIDPA shows that we can increase security, reduce unlawful presence, and respect due process at the same time.”**

# A Modern Framework for Lawful, Orderly Immigration

IIDPA addresses failures across border enforcement, labor markets, due-process protections, and administrative capacity. The bill includes:

## ✔ Four Compliance Pathways (“The Four Doors”)

**Door 1 — Enhanced Voluntary Departure**  
• One-time, biometric-verified voluntary departure  
• No removal order  
• No Strike applied  
• Only medical-emergency waivers  

**Door 2 — Residency Track (4–8 Years)**  
• Continuous residence, tax compliance, English proficiency  
• Conditional Residency → LPR → citizenship eligibility  

**Door 3 — Labor Integrity Track**  
• Nationwide E-Verify phase-in  
• Employer penalties and incentives  
• Worker Compliance Visa (WCV)  
• Data protected from enforcement use (except in cases of fraud or national security)  

**Door 4 — National Service Track**  
• Military or civilian service  
• 2,000 military / 5,000 civilian slots annually  
• Fast-track naturalization

## ✔ Two-Strike Enforcement System

**Strike 1:**  
• First violation after enactment  
• 5-year bar from Doors 2–4  
• Access to voluntary departure or INA §240 proceedings  

**Strike 2:**  
• Permanent ineligibility for Doors and re-entry  
• Limited humanitarian waivers

## ✔ Constitutional Guardrails

• No identification demands without reasonable suspicion of a criminal offense  
• No profiling based on race, ethnicity, accent, or perceived status  
• Exclusion of evidence from egregious violations  
• DHS must implement strict data-minimization standards

## ✔ Border Security & Labor Enforcement Modernization

• $5B for sensors, drones, data integration, and staffing  
• Upgraded Border Patrol hiring and retention  
• E-Verify modernization  
• Strong worker protections and fraud reduction
